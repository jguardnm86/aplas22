    We recommend a direct installation of the latest MPS - 2021.2 (https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/download/) and then opening the repository inside that MPS using File -> Open, pointing the folder to the root of the repo. There will be errors but this can be ignored. Click on apiSL language (with an L) and say "Rebuild Language". You should also build the apiSL.runtime solution (with an S icon). You can build both of them together if you like by group selecting them (CMD + click) on a Mac. Once you are done with these steps, you can use jGuard as indicated in the video.
